I am Zhiqiu Xia, currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Rutgers University](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/), advised by [Prof. Hang Liu](https://asherliu.github.io/). Before that, I got my B.S. degree (with honor) in Data Science and Technology from [the HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), where I was honored to work with [Prof. Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/).
